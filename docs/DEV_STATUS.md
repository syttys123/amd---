# Development Status

Last updated: 2026-11-09

## Objective

Create a broadly compatible, open-source AMD laptop power manager with:

- A native Windows GUI and notification-area workflow.
- A privileged worker that owns all hardware access.
- Capability detection instead of hardcoded assumptions.
- Read-back verification and clear firmware-limit diagnostics.
- Portable and installed distribution packages.
- Documentation, compatibility evidence, and release media.

## Source of Truth

This file is the first file every maintenance session must read. Update it
after each meaningful change. Conversation history and compacted summaries are
not authoritative.

## Current Repo State

- GitHub remote: `https://github.com/syttys123/amd-mobile-power.git`
- Local directory: `D:\amd-mobile-power`
- Stable deployment directory: `C:\RyzenAdj`
- Documentation audit starting point: commit `53e1935` (`ci: build portable
  package on Windows`). Always verify the live value with `git rev-parse HEAD`;
  this line is historical evidence, not a permanent current-head marker.
- The remote was empty when cloned.
- The repository now contains the documentation and maintenance baseline.
- The initial .NET 8 solution skeleton builds with zero warnings and errors.
- Baseline commit `f9d1be5` was pushed to `origin/main`.
- The intended project name is `amd-mobile-power`. The GitHub repository still
  uses the original `amd-mobile-power` URL because GitHub CLI is not installed locally.
- The current Release build has 35 passing tests across Core and Worker.
- A real hardware read-only probe against the development laptop succeeded.
- The repository GUI now reads through the named pipe and updates every second.
- The GUI defaults to read-only; hardware writes require the explicit
  `--enable-write-controls` development flag.
- A self-contained Windows x64 portable ZIP now builds reproducibly.
- The current development package predates the current commit and must be
  rebuilt before any release-candidate validation.

## Development Workflow

- Develop only under `D:\amd-mobile-power`.
- Build and test from source on D:.
- Promote a build to `C:\RyzenAdj` only after automated and hardware checks.
- Keep the current C: deployment recoverable until the promoted build passes
  startup, tray, worker, and power-limit verification.
- Never edit production files in `C:\RyzenAdj` as part of normal development.

## Working Prototype

A working prototype exists outside this repository at `C:\RyzenAdj` on the
current development laptop.

Verified prototype behavior:

- CPU: AMD Ryzen 7 8845HS.
- Worker runs under PowerShell 7.6.9.
- Native `RyzenPower.exe` shell already provides GUI, taskbar icon, tray icon,
  close-to-tray, single-instance wake-up, and editable presets.
- Background supervisor launches the PowerShell 7 worker through a hidden
  scheduled task.
- Current development mode during the last verification: AC power, 25 W.
- STAPM, Fast, and Slow limits read back as 25.00 W in that state.
- At a requested 45 W, Fast and Slow read back as 45 W, but firmware clamps
  STAPM back to 25 W. Even `--max-performance` did not lift that clamp.

Prototype assets and files include:

- `RyzenPower.exe`
- `src/RyzenPowerGui.cs`
- `src/make-icon.ps1`
- `assets/ryzen-power.ico`
- `power-gui.ps1`
- `powerctl.ps1`
- `ryzen-worker.ps1`
- `readjust-service.vbs`
- RyzenAdj binaries and WinRing0 dependencies

The prototype is not yet copied into this repository. Dependency and license
review must happen before vendoring binary files.

- Added `build-ryzenadj.ps1` and successfully built `libryzenadj.dll` from the
  pinned submodule with Visual Studio 2026 and CMake.
- Recorded RyzenAdj LGPL-3.0 and unresolved Windows-driver redistribution
  concerns in the third-party notices.
- Added an opt-in native RyzenAdj adapter that loads runtime dependencies beside
  the worker executable and exposes capability and telemetry reads.
- Added `getSnapshot` as a read-only named pipe command with profile matching.
- Added mandatory target-range and capability validation inside the adapter
  before any future power-limit write.
- Verified a clean Release build with zero warnings and 22 passing tests.
- Verified `getCapabilities` and `getSnapshot` on the Ryzen 7 8845HS:
  - SMU BIOS interface `15`.
  - PM table `4c0009`.
  - STAPM, Fast, and Slow all reported as supported.
  - Matched profile `hawk-point-8845hs`.
  - Probe ran while on AC and performed no hardware writes.
- Added the `applyTarget` named pipe contract.
- Added profile-aware and capability-aware target validation.
- Added mandatory read-back checks and automatic STAPM/Fast/Slow restore when a
  write or read-back fails.
- Added adapter tests for successful writes, firmware clamps, partial writes,
  missing read-backs, unexpected read-back increases, native exceptions, and
  restore failures.
- Added `docs/HARDWARE_TEST_PROCEDURE.md`.
- Added the native WinForms read-only GUI shell with:
  - Named pipe snapshots instead of shared text files.
  - Hidden worker startup with no console window.
  - CPU, SMU, PM table, power line, live power, limits, and temperature display.
  - One-second telemetry refresh without overlapping requests.
  - Editable 12/25/45 W presets stored under `%LocalAppData%\AmdMobilePower`.
  - Tray icon, close-to-tray behavior, single-instance wake-up, and app icon.
- Verified the GUI at 175% Windows display scaling with the two-column layout
  fully visible and no clipped labels.
- Verified that a second GUI launch exits and wakes the existing instance.
- Verified that the worker runs without a visible window.
- Added `build-package.ps1` and `docs/PACKAGING.md`.
- Verified the packaged GUI starts only one visible GUI process and launches
  `worker\AmdMobilePower.Worker.exe` with no visible console window.
- Verified the packaged worker responds to `getSnapshot` with the expected
  8845HS platform and telemetry data.
- Current local package:
  - Path: `artifacts/packages/amd-mobile-power-v0.1.0-win-x64.zip`
  - Size: 106,634,120 bytes
  - SHA256:
    `ed58addb7bb67dc9a095b8fba6337755dd198adb91b681de7ede612f35d21274`
  - Source commit: `5f844eb`
  - Working tree at build time: clean
  - Relationship to current head: stale by one commit; rebuild required before
    claims about the current CI build
- Verified first install, overwrite upgrade, and uninstall against an isolated
  `artifacts/test-install` directory without changing shell integration.
- Added CI-side portable package generation with uploaded ZIP and SHA256
  artifacts on pushes.
- Made `build-ryzenadj.ps1` detect Visual Studio 2019/2022/2026 automatically;
  the VS 2026 local rebuild path was reverified.
- Added `exportDiagnostics` over the named pipe.
- Diagnostics include platform capability, profile match, telemetry, worker/OS
  architecture, executable directory, and SHA256 values for four RyzenAdj
  runtime files.
- Verified a real diagnostics export on the 8845HS with all four runtime files
  present and hashed.
- Added an explicit worker-level `--enable-write-controls` gate in addition to
  the GUI flag.
- Added battery/AC power policy settings with a one-second monitor and automatic
  switching on power-line changes.
- Added a named hardware-owner mutex and legacy `RyzenPower`/`ryzenadj` process
  detection.
- Reproduced an access violation caused by running the legacy and new hardware
  owners together; the new GUI now blocks startup and reports the conflicting
  process instead of launching a second RyzenAdj owner.
- Added GUI controls for optional automatic battery/AC targets; they remain
  disabled in read-only mode.
- Persisted automatic policy settings in the existing local UI state file so
  presets and policy updates do not overwrite each other.
- Added a documentation index, installation/recovery guide, security guide,
  supported-hardware guide, and refreshed README.
- Clarified that read-only mode is a runtime write gate, not a filesystem mode
  or lack of write-capable code.
- Reconciled architecture documentation with the current child-worker process,
  named-pipe commands, package profiles, and LocalAppData storage.
- Renamed live STAPM, PPT Fast, PPT Slow, and temperature captions to
  "实际 / 上限" so requested targets cannot be mistaken for current firmware
  limits.
- Expanded hardware-owner detection to cover the legacy
  `Local\RyzenAdjPowerWorker` mutex and running `\AMD\RyzenAdj*` scheduled tasks.
- Confirmed on the development laptop that closing `RyzenPower.exe` left
  `\AMD\RyzenAdjWatch` running with an elevated hidden PowerShell worker; the
  old process-name-only check missed it and a read-only probe crashed natively.
- Added a Core regression test for legacy-worker mutex detection. The suite now
  has 36 passing tests: 13 Core and 23 Worker.

## In Progress

- Execute the first supervised no-change hardware write test.
- Confirm no worker process remains after the hardware test.
- Runtime-verify close-to-tray and tray-icon behavior through a manual desktop
  pass.
- Resolve WinRing0/inpout redistribution licensing before public binary release.
- Rebuild the release-candidate package from the current clean commit and record
  the resulting hash.
- Add more AMD generation profiles and verify a second physical laptop when
  available.
- Complete release screenshots, project introduction, and promotional media.

## Next Concrete Task

Run the controlled no-change write test while connected to AC, then verify the
initial and final STAPM/Fast/Slow limits match. Do not expose write controls in
the public package until this test passes. Before that test, stop the legacy
`RyzenPower` process with explicit operator approval and preserve the stable
`C:\RyzenAdj` deployment.

## Known Risks

- Windows driver security software may block WinRing0.
- Firmware and EC behavior varies by laptop vendor and BIOS profile.
- STAPM writes may report success while being clamped.
- RyzenAdj LGPL and WinRing0 redistribution terms require review.
- Bilibili publishing requires an authenticated session and final human review.

## Release Gates

Do not publish a stable release or promotional video until:

- GUI and worker communicate through the documented named pipe protocol.
- At least two AMD platforms or generations have manual verification evidence.
- Read-back verification is mandatory for every limit.
- Portable ZIP and installer both build reproducibly.
- Installation, upgrade, and uninstall are tested.
- Third-party notices and licenses are complete.
- A release checklist and installation documentation exist.
